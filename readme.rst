## Installation

### Prerequisites

- PHP 7.3 or higher
- MySQL database
- Apache or Nginx web server

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/admin-panel-codeigniter.git
   cd admin-panel-codeigniter
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Download the latest version of CodeIgniter from [https://codeigniter.com/download](https://codeigniter.com/download).
   - Extract the CodeIgniter files into your project folder.

3. **Database Configuration**:

   - Create a MySQL database and import the `database.sql` file (found in the `sql` folder) to create the necessary tables.
   - Update the database credentials in the `application/config/database.php` file:

     ```php
     $db['default'] = array(
         'dsn'   => '',
         'hostname' => 'localhost',
         'username' => 'your_database_username',
         'password' => 'your_database_password',
         'database' => 'your_database_name',
         'dbdriver' => 'mysqli',
         'dbprefix' => '',
         'pconnect' => FALSE,
         'db_debug' => (ENVIRONMENT !== 'production'),
         'cache_on' => FALSE,
         'cachedir' => '',
         'char_set' => 'utf8',
         'dbcollat' => 'utf8_general_ci',
         'swap_pre' => '',
         'encrypt' => FALSE,
         'compress' => FALSE,
         'stricton' => FALSE,
         'failover' => array(),
         'save_queries' => TRUE
     );
     ```

4. **Set Base URL**:

   Update the `application/config/config.php` file with your base URL:

   ```php
   $config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost/admin-panel-codeigniter/';
   ```

5. **Set Up Session**:

   Ensure that sessions are configured by checking the `application/config/config.php` file. Set up the session settings:

   ```php
   $config['sess_driver'] = 'files';
   $config['sess_cookie_name'] = 'ci_session';
   $config['sess_expiration'] = 7200;
   $config['sess_save_path'] = NULL;  // Leave it as NULL if you're using file-based sessions
   ```

6. **Run the Application**:

   Start your local development server and navigate to the URL (e.g., `http://localhost/admin-panel-codeigniter/`) to access the admin panel.

## Admin Login
